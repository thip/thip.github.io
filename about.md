I am a lead engineer with a deep interest in the messy stuff that surrounds software development. 
I'm not attached to any particular technology or tools, and I'm happiest when I can get stuck in with my team to deliver useful things for people.
I'm a strong believer in making everything as ridiculousely simple as I can get away with.
