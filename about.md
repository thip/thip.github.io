I am a senior software engineer with a particular interest in process and practices. 
I consider myself a generalist who enjoys opportunities to work with new languages and technologies, 
but I'm also not afraid to dive into legacy. 
I believe in disciplined Test Driven Development and Clean Architecture - there is nothing that I love more than helping people discover the benefits of these practices for themselves.
